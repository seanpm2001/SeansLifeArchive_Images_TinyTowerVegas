> Personal side note: It looks like data for May 29th 2020 is missing as well, I just have an empty directory.

Another note to prevent insanity tomorrow if I try to figure this out: it seems like normal TT data was swapped for TTV data for the 28th, the 29th has no errors, so data is missing for the 28th, 30th, and 31st. If I get my head stuck on this, I should remember.issue(1);
