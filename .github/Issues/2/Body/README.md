### [March 2020] Data for March 30th and 31st missing

Data for the 30th and 31st of March is not on my laptops solid state drive. This was around the time of the Ina Linux era, where I had difficulty managing files in the transition to Linux. The files are likely on an external hard drive. I don't have time to look for them at the moment.
