### [Kept naming error] Original 3.13.2020 is actually March 12th 2020

The original 3.13.2020 directory (the one without an `A` at the end) is actually for March 12th 2020. This is an error that was kept in the upload process. What happened is I accidentally named the March 12th 2020 data 1 day ahead by accident, then tried to correct it the next day without having to rename by doing the correct date, but with an A at the end.
