# SeansLifeArchive_Images_TinyTowerVegas
The module for my life story project that contains my Tiny Tower Vegas images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all mt daily Tiny Tower session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.tinytower&hl=en&gl=US) but when I originally played in 2012/2013, I played the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-tower/id422667065)

These daily pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images. You can learn more about Tiny Tower by [clicking/tapping here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Tower).

I started playing Tiny Tower Vegas again on January 14th 2020. Currently, images on my local hard drive span from January 14th 2020 to March 28th 2020, but there are some extra images up until a little past day 100, when I stopped playing. I played the game in the past before the Mobage shutdown, but didn't get very far (6 floors) I quit playing this game due to:

> * Lack of interest

> * Time issues

> * Inability to cloud save

> * A huge loss of progress in another game sometime in April/May/June 2020.
